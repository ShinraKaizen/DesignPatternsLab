# DesignPatternsLab

## Overview

Welcome to the DesignPatternsLab, a comprehensive repository dedicated to exploring, implementing, and demonstrating various software design patterns. The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience for understanding the structure, purpose, and applicability of different design patterns within software development, particularly in the context of .NET and C#.

## Purpose

This repository serves as an educational resource for developers at all levels who are interested in deepening their understanding of design patterns. By providing real-world examples and implementations, the DesignPatternsLab aims to illustrate how design patterns can solve common software design problems, enhance code readability, and improve software maintainability and scalability.

## Design Patterns

Below is a list of design patterns that have been explored and implemented in this project. Each pattern is contained within its own dedicated directory, complete with a `README.md` file explaining the pattern's details, use cases, and implementation notes.

### Creational Patterns

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. The implementation can be found in the [Singleton](./DesignPatternsLibrary/Singleton) directory.

### Structural Patterns

_(More patterns will be added here)_

### Behavioral Patterns

_(More patterns will be added here)_

## Getting Started

To dive into a specific design pattern, navigate to its corresponding directory where you'll find a detailed `README.md` file along with the source code demonstrating the pattern's implementation.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (`DesignPatternsLab.sln`) in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Explore the projects and run the examples to see the design patterns in action.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, new design pattern examples, or any corrections, please feel free to contribute. You can do so by:

- Forking the repository and creating a pull request with your changes.
- Opening an issue to discuss potential changes or enhancements.

_This README is designed to be expandable. As new design patterns are added to the project, they should be listed in the appropriate section above to maintain an up-to-date overview of the repository's contents._
