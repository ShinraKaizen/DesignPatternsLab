# Singleton Pattern Project

## Overview
This project is a practical exploration of the Singleton design pattern, one of the most fundamental patterns in software design. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It's particularly useful when managing resources such as configuration settings, where exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation and use of the Singleton pattern within a .NET environment. Through the development of a `ConfigurationManager` class, we showcase how the Singleton pattern can ensure that configuration settings are centrally managed and accessible in a thread-safe manner throughout an application.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the Singleton design pattern and its applicability.
- Explore thread-safe implementation techniques for Singletons in .NET.
- Learn how to structure and document a design pattern within a project.

## Guide to Recreate the Singleton Pattern

### Step 1: Create the Project
1. Open Visual Studio and create a new Console Application project.
2. Name your solution `DesignPatternsLab` to indicate its broader educational purpose.

### Step 2: Implement the Singleton
1. Within your project, create a folder named `Singleton` to hold your pattern implementation.
2. Inside the `Singleton` folder, add a new class named `ConfigurationManager`.
3. Implement the Singleton pattern in the `ConfigurationManager` class:
   - Make the constructor private.
   - Create a private static variable to hold the instance.
   - Implement a public static method named `GetInstance` to return the Singleton instance.

### Step 3: Thread Safety
Ensure your Singleton implementation is thread-safe. You can achieve this by:
- Using locks within the `GetInstance` method.
- Leveraging .NET's `Lazy<T>` type for lazy initialization.

### Step 4: Configuration Management
1. Implement a method within `ConfigurationManager` to load configuration settings, for example, from a JSON file.
2. Provide public methods or properties to access these settings.

### Step 5: Demonstrate Usage
In the `Program.cs` file of your console application:
1. Create a simple menu system to allow users to interact with the Singleton.
2. Demonstrate creating instances of the `ConfigurationManager` and accessing configuration settings.

### Step 6: Documentation
- Document your implementation within the class files using comments.
- Create a `README.md` file in the `Singleton` folder explaining the pattern and your implementation.

### Step 7: Share Your Work
- Publish your project to a public GitHub repository.
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of your repository explaining the project and how to run it.
